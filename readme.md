# Plant Tycoon CLI

## Game Mechanics

- Players are able to buy seeds and sell plants
- Each plant will have an internal growth rate and DNA
- Mature plant will produce pollen and seeds
- Use pollen on different species to mutate the seeds
- Growing is done automatically
- This will be the baseline for my upcoming Plant Tycoon FOSS app

## Technical Decisions

- Text based or TUI?
- Procedure generated?
- Add tools, soils, insects, decorations, leaderboards, etc.?
